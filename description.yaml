  description: |
    This project is a calculation programm to model quantum properties of light propagation
    along an array of single mode waveguides with cubic nonliniarity. The considered process
    is down conversion of the pump. Pump is allowed to propagate in transversal direction.
    The numeric solution of the given system of equetions is performed here by using 4th order
    Runge–Kutta method.
parameters:
  #parameters are double, named numbers which influence on result of calculation
  #parameters are defined as a list of maps with two fields: name , description
  - name: dt
    description: time difference between two consecutive calculating steps
  - name: Nsteps
    description: number of calculating time steps
  - name: Nout
    description: number of time marks at which desired values will be calculated
  - name: Nfibs
    description: number of waveguides in the array
  - name: Nfibs_calc
    description: size of waveguides subarray near the central one, for which will be calculated logarithmic negativity (for each pair in subarray)
  - name: gamma
    description: parameter defined pump intensity
properties:
  #properties are values which influence the calculation process but not the result 
  #(except some accuracy issues)
  #ccs introduce two default properties: output_path, and tmp_path
  #output_path - the destination, where to put the result .nc file
  #tmp_path - folder where could be placed some tmp files. ccs will check for this folder and delete it after the work finished (with success or failure)
  #you should not redefine this properties
  #Here should go the list of items, each of which describes single property
  - name: cuda_device
    optional: false # a boolean property which shows if this property is required for calculation. Default: false 
    list: false #flag to show that if need to set a list of properties here. Default: false
    type: int #shows the type of the property: currently we support only int, string, float, boolean  
outputs:
  #a list of outputs which calculator will generate. Should be defined as a list of items
  - name: time
    description: The array with Nout elements with values of time marks at which all other values were calculated
  - name: I
    description: The array with size Nout*Nfibs with values of mean photon number in each waveguide calculated at time markes defined in "time" output
  - name: EN
    description: The array with size Nout*Nfibs_calc*Nfibs_calc with logarithmic negativity values, calculated for each pair in subarray of size Nfibs_calc near central waveguide
